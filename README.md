# How does it measure the performance?

Moves the character around the screen like a DVD logo moving around the screen. It will move the canvas once it has hit the edge of the screen.
It will save all of the FPS info and rendering lists info in the debug.txt file.

However, a summary file will be generated once the test is over.


# Can I change the settings of how I want it to be benchmarked?

Yes, there is a settings file that explains all of the available options to you.

# How to I read the summary file data?

It will display:
- Average Frames Per Second
- Minimum and Maximum FPS achieved during the test
- The maximum and minimum deviation of FPS relative to the average FPS in a percentage.
